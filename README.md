## Metastability in networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons

This repository contains code to generate figures associated with the above paper.

Each file in the folder 'Figures' named 'Figure *.ipynb' is a jupyter file that can be run to generate each figure. The data generated from simulations and theory is saved in the Data folder which has folders within for each figure.

The simulations can be run by running 'main.py' in the 'Code' folder. Be sure to change parameters associated with the simulation being run in 'parameters.py'.
